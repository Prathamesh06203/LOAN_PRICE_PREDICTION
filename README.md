bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb
Project Structure
Loan_Approval_Prediction.ipynb: Main notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
data/: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
models/: Directory to save and load trained models.
scripts/: Directory for any additional scripts used in the project.

## Results
Include a brief summary of the results here, such as the accuracy of the model or any key findings.

Gaussian Naivey Bayes

Maximum accuracy achieved by Random Forest of 83.88%.
Average accuracy achieved by all classifiers is 83.11%.

More improvement in terms of Data analysis , Data wrangling, Model selection will be tried to increase accuracy.
